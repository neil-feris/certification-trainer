      'Cymbal is an online retailer experiencing significant growth. The retailer specializes in a large assortment of products spanning several retail sub-verticals, which makes managing their extensive product catalog a constant challenge.',
    solutionConcept: `Cymbal wants to modernize its operations and enhance the customer experience in three core areas:

• Catalog and Content Enrichment: Cymbal wants to automate and improve the accuracy of their product catalog by utilizing gen AI to generate product attributes, descriptions, and images from supplier-provided information. This solution will streamline their catalog management, reduce manual effort and errors, and ensure information is consistent across all their sales channels.

• Conversational Commerce with Product Discovery: To enhance customer engagement and drive sales conversion, Cymbal wants to implement a Conversational Commerce solution. This solution will involve integrating AI-powered virtual agents into their website and mobile app to provide customers with a personalized and intuitive shopping experience through natural language conversations. These agents will utilize Google Cloud's Discovery AI to process user requests and retrieve the most relevant products based on each customer's needs and preferences, creating a more engaging and satisfying shopping journey.

• Technical Stack Modernization: To streamline operations and reduce costs around manual processes, data transfer, error handling and remediation, Cymbal wants to modernize their technical stack with cloud-based infrastructure, secure and efficient data handling, 3rd party integrations, and proactive monitoring and security.`,
    existingTechnicalEnvironment: `Cymbal currently relies on the following environment:

• A mix of on-premises and cloud-based systems.
• A variety of databases, including MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Redis, and MongoDB, to store and manage its vast product catalog and customer data.
• Kubernetes clusters to run containerized applications.
• Legacy file-based integrations with on-premises systems, including SFTP file transfers, ETL batch processing.
• A custom-built web application which allows customers to browse the product catalog by querying the relational databases for names and categories of products.
• An IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system to handle initial customer calls and route them to the appropriate departments or agents.
• Call center agents who receive transferred calls from the IVR system and manually enter orders into the system when a customer can't complete a transaction on their own.
• Various open source tools for monitoring such as Grafana, Nagios, and Elastic.

The current technical environment has encountered significant challenges: manual processes are time-consuming and error-prone, data silos limit a unified view of the customer journey, and integrating new technologies is difficult.`,
