## Codebase Patterns
- Shared types are all in a single `packages/shared/src/index.ts` file — add new types at the bottom
- Use `/Users/neil.feris/.nvm/versions/node/v22.2.0/bin/npx tsc --project <path>/tsconfig.json --noEmit` for typecheck (shell has broken nvm lazy-loading, call node binary directly)
- lint-staged runs on commit: eslint --fix + prettier --write
- XP types already exist (XP_AWARDS, calculateLevel, etc.) — achievement XP rewards should integrate with existing awardCustomXP flow
- Existing pattern for criteria-style constants: use `as const` arrays and Record types
- Startup migrations: version-tracked in `_startup_migrations` table, next available version is 7
- Seeding pattern: use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT(code) DO UPDATE SET ...` for upsert logic in SQLite
- Schema index pattern: `(table) => [uniqueIndex('name').on(table.col1, table.col2)]`
- All user-scoped tables: `userId` references `users.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- `awardCustomXP(userId, amount, source)` uses source as idempotency key — for achievements use `achievement:{code}` as source
- Service pattern: export individual functions, import db/schema from `../db/index.js`, import shared types from `@ace-prep/shared`
- Don't import unused drizzle operators — lint-staged will fail the commit
- lint-staged checks entire file, not just your changes — fix any pre-existing unused imports in files you touch
- Route auth pattern: `fastify.addHook('preHandler', authenticate)` at top of route function
- Routes registered in `packages/server/src/index.ts` with `fastify.register(routes, { prefix: '/api/...' })`
- `userStreaks.currentStreak` gives live streak count — no date computation needed
- SR reviews are handled in `packages/server/src/routes/questions.ts` (POST /review endpoint)
- Both study.ts and drills.ts had unused `{ db, schema }` — only `db` is used; check all route files
- `isNotNull(spacedRepetition.lastReviewedAt)` gives count of reviewed SR cards for a user
- `streakResult.streak.currentStreak` is the post-update streak value — use this when passing streak to achievement context
- Learning path completion (POST `/learning-path/:certId/:order/complete`) in study.ts — needs both streak and completionist achievement checks
- `performanceStats` table is NOT actively written by routes — domain-level stats are computed from `examResponses`/`studySessionResponses` via SQL GROUP BY on `domains.id`
- Client components: CSS Modules + CSS variables from globals.css, export from `components/common/index.ts`
- Rarity color mapping: common=#4a9eff (blue), rare=#a855f7 (purple), epic=#f59e0b (gold)
- Card hover pattern: `translateY(-2px)` lift + `var(--shadow-md)` + reveal tooltip via opacity
- Fonts: Outfit for text, JetBrains Mono for data/counts/labels — set via `var(--font-sans)` and `var(--font-mono)`
- Page route pattern: `<ProtectedRoute><AppShell><RouteErrorBoundary><Component /></RouteErrorBoundary></AppShell></ProtectedRoute>`
- Client API pattern: define response interfaces, then `export const fooApi = { method: () => request<Type>('/path') }`
- React Query invalidation: hierarchical keys like `['achievements']` and `['achievements', 'progress']` allow targeted cache busting
- Notification utility pattern: create a util in `utils/` that imports `showToast` + `queryClient` directly for use outside React components (see `streakNotifications.ts`, `achievementNotifications.ts`)
- Shared package rebuild required: after changing shared types, run `npm run build -w @ace-prep/shared` before client typecheck picks up changes

## 2026-01-23 - US-001
- Implemented all achievement type definitions in `packages/shared/src/index.ts`
- Added: AchievementRarity, ACHIEVEMENT_XP_REWARDS, AchievementCriteriaType, AchievementCriteria, AchievementDefinition, UserAchievement, AchievementProgress, AchievementUnlockResponse
- Added ACHIEVEMENTS constant with all 12 badge definitions (first-steps, perfect-score, consistent-7, dedicated-30, century-streak, domain-expert, speed-demon, night-owl, early-bird, completionist, reviewer-100, exam-veteran)
- Files changed: `packages/shared/src/index.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Shell has broken nvm lazy-loading — always use direct path `/Users/neil.feris/.nvm/versions/node/v22.2.0/bin/npx` for npm/npx commands
  - The shared package is a single index.ts file, no separate module files
  - All types are exported directly (no re-export barrel pattern)
  - XP integration already has `XPAwardType` and `XP_AWARDS` — achievement XP will likely need a custom award type
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-002
- Added `achievements` table (id, code unique, name, description, rarity, icon, criteria_type, criteria_json, created_at) to Drizzle schema
- Added `user_achievements` table (id, user_id, achievement_code, xp_awarded, unlocked_at) with unique index on (user_id, achievement_code) and index on user_id
- Added startup migration version 5 (`add_achievement_tables`) with idempotent CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pattern
- Exported Drizzle types: AchievementRecord, NewAchievement, UserAchievementRecord, NewUserAchievement
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/db/schema.ts`, `packages/server/src/db/startupMigrations.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Startup migrations use a `_startup_migrations` tracking table and version numbers — next available version is 6
  - Schema tables use `(table) => [...]` syntax for indices (new Drizzle v2 pattern)
  - The `code` column on achievements is already unique via table definition AND explicit index — matches certifications pattern
  - user_id foreign key references `users.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE` — consistent with other user-related tables
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-003
- Added startup migration version 6 (`seed_achievement_definitions`) to seed all 12 badge definitions
- Uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT(code) DO UPDATE SET ...` for upsert logic — safe to re-run without duplicates
- All 12 badges seeded: first-steps, perfect-score, consistent-7, dedicated-30, century-streak, domain-expert, speed-demon, night-owl, early-bird, completionist, reviewer-100, exam-veteran
- Each badge stores criteria_type and criteria_json matching the shared ACHIEVEMENTS constant
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/db/startupMigrations.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SQLite supports `ON CONFLICT(col) DO UPDATE SET ...` syntax for upserts — no need for separate check-then-insert
  - Migration ordering matters: seed migrations must come after table-creation migrations in the array
  - Next available migration version is 7
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-004
- Created `packages/server/src/services/achievementService.ts`
- Implemented `checkAndUnlock(userId, context)` function that checks all 12 achievements
- Context interface: activity, score, totalQuestions, streak, timeOfDay, durationSeconds, domainAccuracy, domainAttempts, pathComplete, cumulativeSrReviews, cumulativeExams
- Dedicated checker functions for each criteria_type: first_activity, perfect_score, streak, domain_mastery, speed, time_of_day, cumulative_count, path_completion
- On unlock: inserts user_achievement record + awards rarity XP via `awardCustomXP`
- Idempotent: queries existing user_achievements and skips already-unlocked badges
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/services/achievementService.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `awardCustomXP` source-based idempotency means achievement XP won't double-award even if checkAndUnlock is called multiple times
  - lint-staged will reject commits with unused imports — always remove unused drizzle operators
  - The service exports `AchievementContext` interface for use by route handlers that call `checkAndUnlock`
  - Checker functions are pure (no DB access) — they only evaluate context against criteria; cumulative counts must be pre-fetched by callers
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-005
- Created `packages/server/src/routes/achievements.ts` with two endpoints:
  - `GET /api/achievements` — returns all badge definitions with user unlock status (earned/locked, unlockedAt, xpAwarded)
  - `GET /api/achievements/progress` — returns progress toward locked achievements (currentValue, targetValue, percentComplete)
- Registered routes in `packages/server/src/index.ts` under `/api/achievements` prefix
- Both endpoints require authentication via `authenticate` preHandler hook
- Progress calculation uses streak, completed exam count, and SR review count for quantifiable achievements
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/routes/achievements.ts` (new), `packages/server/src/index.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Route pattern: `fastify.addHook('preHandler', authenticate)` at top of route function for auth on all routes
  - `schema.exams.status` can be filtered with `eq()` for 'completed' — always filter when counting completions
  - `spacedRepetition.lastReviewedAt` is nullable — use `isNotNull()` to count only actually-reviewed cards
  - `userStreaks.currentStreak` is the live streak count — no need to compute from dates
  - For progress, streak-based and cumulative-count achievements have quantifiable progress; others default to 0/1
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-006
- Integrated achievement checks into the exam completion endpoint (`/:id/complete`)
- After scoring + streak + XP, calls `checkAndUnlock` with context: activity=exam, score (correct count), totalQuestions, cumulativeExams
- Counts completed exams via SQL aggregate for `exam-veteran` badge check
- Adds `achievementsUnlocked` array to the response
- Graceful degradation: try/catch ensures exam completion succeeds even if achievement check fails
- Fixed pre-existing lint issue: removed unused `schema` import from exams.ts
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/routes/exams.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The exams.ts route file imported `{ db, schema }` from db/index.js but only used `db` — lint-staged catches these even if pre-existing when you touch the file
  - Exam completion already follows graceful-degradation pattern for streak and XP — achievement check should match the same try/catch pattern
  - `AchievementContext` is exported from the service, import it alongside `checkAndUnlock`
  - `cumulativeExams` count should filter by `status: 'completed'` — don't count in-progress or abandoned exams
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-007
- Integrated achievement checks into study session completion, drill completion, and review submission
- Study session completion (`/sessions/:id/complete`): checks night-owl, early-bird via `timeOfDay` context
- Drill completion (`/:id/complete`): checks speed-demon via `activity=drill`, `durationSeconds`, and `score`/`totalQuestions` context
- Review submission (`POST /review` in questions.ts): checks reviewer-100 via cumulative SR card count (cards with `lastReviewedAt` not null)
- All three include `achievementsUnlocked` array in responses
- Graceful degradation: each check wrapped in try/catch — activity completion succeeds even if achievement check fails
- Fixed pre-existing lint issues: removed unused `schema` import from both study.ts and drills.ts
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/routes/study.ts`, `packages/server/src/routes/drills.ts`, `packages/server/src/routes/questions.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Both study.ts and drills.ts had unused `schema` import from `../db/index.js` — always check for this pre-existing issue in route files
  - For `reviewer-100`, count SR cards where `lastReviewedAt` is not null (uses `isNotNull` from drizzle-orm)
  - The questions.ts route file handles SR reviews (not a separate review route file)
  - `checkAndUnlock` is fully idempotent — safe to call from multiple activity types without risk of double-awarding
  - Import pattern: `import { checkAndUnlock, AchievementContext } from '../services/achievementService.js'` + `import type { AchievementUnlockResponse } from '@ace-prep/shared'`
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-008
- Integrated streak-based achievement checks into all routes that call `updateStreak`
- Captured `streakResult.streak.currentStreak` after each `updateStreak` call and passed it as `streak` in `AchievementContext`
- Routes updated: exams.ts, study.ts (session completion + learning path completion), questions.ts (review)
- Learning path completion: added new achievement check block (previously had no achievement check) with streak context
- Drills.ts does NOT call `updateStreak` — no changes needed there
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/routes/exams.ts`, `packages/server/src/routes/study.ts`, `packages/server/src/routes/questions.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `streakResult.streak.currentStreak` is the updated streak value after `updateStreak` completes — use this for achievement context
  - The learning path completion endpoint in study.ts (POST `/learning-path/:certId/:order/complete`) previously had no achievement check — it only had streak and no XP/achievement handling
  - drills.ts does NOT trigger streak updates — only exams, study sessions, learning path, and reviews do
  - When adding streak to existing achievement contexts, simply append `streak: currentStreak` — the checker ignores undefined fields so it won't break other achievement checks
---

## 2026-01-24 - US-009
- Integrated domain-expert achievement check into exam completion, drill completion, and study session completion
- After each completion, queries domain-level accuracy aggregates from response tables (examResponses for exams, studySessionResponses for drills/study)
- For each domain with 90%+ accuracy and 5+ attempts, calls `checkAndUnlock` with `domainAccuracy` and `domainAttempts` context
- Idempotent: `checkAndUnlock` skips already-unlocked badges, so multiple qualifying domains won't cause issues
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/routes/exams.ts`, `packages/server/src/routes/drills.ts`, `packages/server/src/routes/study.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `performanceStats` table is NOT actively written by route handlers — domain stats are computed on-the-fly from `examResponses`/`studySessionResponses` joined with `questions`/`domains`
  - For domain-expert, aggregate responses by domain using SQL GROUP BY rather than relying on `performanceStats`
  - The `checkAndUnlock` function is idempotent (skips already-unlocked) — safe to call with multiple qualifying domains in a loop
  - Drills and study sessions store responses in `studySessionResponses` table; exams use `examResponses` — different tables, same domain join pattern
---

## 2026-01-24 - US-010
- Integrated completionist achievement check into the learning path completion endpoint (`PATCH /learning-path/:order/complete`)
- After marking an item complete, queries total completed items for the user/certification
- Compares against `LEARNING_PATH_TOTAL` to determine if 100% path completion is reached
- Passes `pathComplete: true` to `checkAndUnlock` context when all items are done
- Combined with existing streak-based achievement check in the same context call
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/routes/study.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `LEARNING_PATH_TOTAL` is already imported in study.ts — it's the `.length` of `LEARNING_PATH_ITEMS` array
  - The completionist check uses `count(*)` from `learningPathProgress` scoped to user + certification — simple and efficient
  - The `pathComplete` flag in `AchievementContext` is checked by the `checkPathCompletion` function which simply checks `=== true`
  - Both streak and completionist can be checked in a single `checkAndUnlock` call by combining context fields
---

## 2026-01-24 - US-011
- Created `BadgeCard.tsx` component in `packages/client/src/components/common/`
- Created `BadgeCard.module.css` with rarity-based styling (common=blue, rare=purple, epic=gold)
- Earned state: full color icon with pulsing glow, unlock date display
- Locked state: grayscale icon with progress bar (shows currentValue/targetValue when applicable)
- Hover reveals description tooltip from bottom of card
- Rarity label shown in mono font with matching color
- Exported from `components/common/index.ts`
- Typecheck, lint, and build all pass
- Files changed: `packages/client/src/components/common/BadgeCard.tsx` (new), `packages/client/src/components/common/BadgeCard.module.css` (new), `packages/client/src/components/common/index.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Client components use CSS Modules (`styles` object import), CSS variables from globals.css
  - Rarity colors: common=#4a9eff (blue), rare=#a855f7 (purple), epic=#f59e0b (gold)
  - Card pattern: `var(--bg-secondary)` background, `var(--border-color)` border, `var(--border-radius-lg)` corners
  - Hover pattern: `translateY(-2px)` + `var(--shadow-md)` + tooltip reveal via opacity transition
  - Font usage: Outfit for labels/names, JetBrains Mono for data/counts/labels
  - The common/index.ts barrel exports all shared components — add new exports alphabetically
  - Progress bar: 4px height, tertiary bg, rarity-colored fill with width transition
---

## 2026-01-24 - US-012
- Created `AchievementsPage.tsx` component in `packages/client/src/components/achievements/`
- Created `AchievementsPage.module.css` with responsive grid layout, filter tabs, rarity grouping, loading/error states
- Added `achievementApi` to `packages/client/src/api/client.ts` with `getAll()` and `getProgress()` endpoints
- Added typed interfaces: `AchievementBadge`, `AchievementsResponse`, `AchievementProgressItem`, `AchievementProgressResponse`
- Added `/achievements` route to `App.tsx` with ProtectedRoute + AppShell + RouteErrorBoundary wrapper
- Added nav link (`🏆 Achievements`) to `AppShell.tsx` NAV_ITEMS between Progress and Review
- Page features: filter tabs (All/Earned/Locked), summary header (X of Y unlocked), grouped by rarity tier (epic → rare → common), responsive grid of BadgeCard components
- Uses React Query with `['achievements']` and `['achievements', 'progress']` query keys
- Imports `AchievementRarity` and `AchievementCriteria` types from `@ace-prep/shared`
- Files changed: `packages/client/src/api/client.ts`, `packages/client/src/App.tsx`, `packages/client/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`, `packages/client/src/components/achievements/AchievementsPage.tsx` (new), `packages/client/src/components/achievements/AchievementsPage.module.css` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Client API pattern: define response interfaces above the API namespace object, use `request<Type>('/path')` pattern
  - Achievement API returns `{ badges, earned, total, locked }` from GET /achievements and `{ progress }` from GET /achievements/progress
  - Routes in App.tsx follow strict pattern: `<Route path="..." element={<ProtectedRoute><AppShell><RouteErrorBoundary><Component /></RouteErrorBoundary></AppShell></ProtectedRoute>} />`
  - Nav items in AppShell.tsx are simple `{ path, label, icon }` objects — emoji icons work fine
  - Page components don't need to be exported from a barrel — they're imported directly by App.tsx
  - Docker browser MCP can't connect to host localhost — browser verification needs direct host access
  - React Query keys: use arrays for hierarchical invalidation (e.g., invalidating `['achievements']` also invalidates `['achievements', 'progress']`)
---

## 2026-01-24 - US-013
- Created `packages/client/src/utils/achievementNotifications.ts` utility with `showAchievementUnlockToasts` function
- Shows one toast per unlocked badge: `{icon} Badge Unlocked: {name} (+{xp} XP)` with type=success and 5s duration
- Invalidates `['achievements']` query cache after unlock (covers both achievements list and progress via hierarchical keys)
- Updated shared types: added `achievementsUnlocked?: AchievementUnlockResponse[]` to `CompleteStudySessionResponse` and `CompleteDrillResponse`
- Updated client API types: added `achievementsUnlocked` to exam complete, review submit, and learning path complete inline response types
- Integrated `showAchievementUnlockToasts` into all 5 completion flows:
  - `examStore.ts` — exam completion
  - `studyStore.ts` — study session completion
  - `drillStore.ts` — drill completion
  - `Review.tsx` — spaced repetition review submission
  - `LearningPathDetail.tsx` — learning path item completion
- Files changed: `packages/shared/src/index.ts`, `packages/client/src/api/client.ts`, `packages/client/src/utils/achievementNotifications.ts` (new), `packages/client/src/stores/examStore.ts`, `packages/client/src/stores/studyStore.ts`, `packages/client/src/stores/drillStore.ts`, `packages/client/src/components/review/Review.tsx`, `packages/client/src/components/study/learning-path/LearningPathDetail.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The notification utility pattern matches `streakNotifications.ts` — utility function that imports `showToast` and `queryClient` directly
  - Shared package must be rebuilt (`npm run build -w @ace-prep/shared`) before client typecheck will see type changes
  - The `queryClient` can be imported directly in utility files for cache invalidation outside of React components
  - All completion flows already follow the same pattern: call API → show streak toast → invalidate cache; achievement toast slots in naturally after streak toast
  - Hierarchical query key invalidation: invalidating `['achievements']` also invalidates `['achievements', 'progress']` automatically
