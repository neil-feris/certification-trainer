## Codebase Patterns
- Shared types are in `packages/shared/src/index.ts` - all new types should be added there
- Use `as const` for constant arrays that need literal types
- Export helper functions alongside their related types for consistency
- Build order: shared → server → client (shared must build first)
- Use `export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" --no-use && nvm exec default` prefix for npm commands to avoid nvm loading issues
- Schema tables: follow existing pattern with `sqliteTable()`, indexes defined in callback, types exported at bottom
- Migration naming: check existing migrations with `ls` - 0007 was already taken, use 0008
- Spaced repetition review submission is POST /review in questions.ts, NOT in study.ts

## Wed 22 Jan 2026 - US-001
- Implemented XP and leveling type definitions in shared package
- Files changed: `packages/shared/src/index.ts`
- Added:
  - `UserXP` interface with totalXp, currentLevel, levelTitle, xpToNextLevel, xpInCurrentLevel, levelProgress
  - `XP_AWARDS` constant with point values for all activity types (question correct/incorrect, exam complete, study session, drills, SR reviews)
  - `LEVEL_THRESHOLDS` array with 12 levels from Novice (0 XP) to Transcendent (10000 XP)
  - `calculateLevel()` pure function to compute level info from total XP
  - `XPAwardResponse` interface for API responses including level-up detection
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The shared package exports everything from a single index.ts file
  - Existing patterns use const arrays with `as const` for literal types (see STREAK_MILESTONES)
  - Level thresholds are designed with increasing gaps between levels for balanced progression
---

## Wed 22 Jan 2026 - US-002
- Implemented database schema for XP/leveling system
- Files changed:
  - `packages/server/src/db/schema.ts` - Added `userXp` table definition
  - `packages/server/src/db/migrations/0008_add_xp_leveling.sql` - Migration file
- Added:
  - `user_xp` table with id, user_id (unique), total_xp, current_level, updated_at
  - Unique index on user_id
  - `UserXpRecord` and `NewUserXp` type exports
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Migration file naming: always check existing migrations before creating - 0007 was already used for streaks
  - Schema pattern: tables use callback for indexes, export both Select and Insert types
  - Follow userStreaks pattern for similar user-linked tables with unique index
---

## Wed 22 Jan 2026 - US-003
- Implemented XP service with award logic
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/services/xpService.ts` (new file)
- Added:
  - `getXP(userId)` function - retrieves user's XP and calculates level info
  - `awardXP(userId, xpType)` function - awards XP using XP_AWARDS constants with upsert
  - `awardCustomXP(userId, amount)` function - for batch operations and bonuses
  - Transaction support for atomicity (prevents race conditions)
  - Level-up detection - returns `newLevel` and `newTitle` when level changes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow streakService.ts pattern for user-centric services with upsert logic
  - Use `db.transaction()` for atomic operations that read-then-write
  - Import db and schema from `../db/index.js` (with .js extension for ESM)
  - Reuse calculateLevel from shared package for consistent level calculations
---

## Wed 22 Jan 2026 - US-004
- Implemented GET /api/progress/xp endpoint
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/routes/progress.ts`
- Added:
  - Import for `getXP` from xpService
  - GET `/api/progress/xp` endpoint that returns UserXP data
  - Uses existing `authenticate` hook applied to all progress routes
  - Returns default level 1 values if no XP record exists for user
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Progress routes already have auth middleware via `fastify.addHook('preHandler', authenticate)`
  - Follow the `/streak` endpoint pattern for simple user data fetch endpoints
  - Service functions should handle the "create default if not exists" logic, not the route
---

## Wed 22 Jan 2026 - US-005
- Integrated XP awards into exam completion endpoint
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/routes/exams.ts`
- Added:
  - Import `awardCustomXP` from xpService and `XP_AWARDS, XPAwardResponse` from shared
  - XP calculation in PATCH /:id/complete after exam transaction
  - Per-question XP: +10 for correct, +2 for incorrect (using XP_AWARDS constants)
  - Exam completion bonus: +50 (XP_AWARDS.EXAM_COMPLETE)
  - Perfect score bonus: +100 if score === 100 (XP_AWARDS.EXAM_PERFECT_SCORE)
  - `xpUpdate` field in response with XPAwardResponse data
  - Graceful degradation: try/catch with logging, xpUpdate is undefined on failure
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `awardCustomXP` for batch XP awards (combining multiple sources into single award)
  - Follow the streakUpdate pattern: calculate in transaction, award after, handle errors gracefully
  - Track correctCount and incorrectCount in transaction return for XP calculation
  - XP awards are non-critical - don't fail the main operation if XP service fails
---

## Wed 22 Jan 2026 - US-006
- Integrated XP awards into study session completion endpoint
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/routes/study.ts`
- Added:
  - Import `awardCustomXP` from xpService and `XP_AWARDS, XPAwardResponse` from shared
  - XP calculation in PATCH /sessions/:id/complete after streak update
  - Per-question XP: +10 for correct, +2 for incorrect (using XP_AWARDS constants)
  - Study session completion bonus: +25 (XP_AWARDS.STUDY_SESSION_COMPLETE)
  - `xpUpdate` field in response with XPAwardResponse data
  - Graceful degradation: try/catch with logging, xpUpdate is undefined on failure
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Study sessions follow same pattern as exams for XP integration
  - Both streak and XP updates happen after the main transaction, both with graceful degradation
  - actualCorrect and actualTotal are already computed before the transaction, reuse them for XP calculation
---

## Wed 22 Jan 2026 - US-007
- Integrated XP awards into timed drill completion endpoint
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/routes/drills.ts`
- Added:
  - Import `awardCustomXP` from xpService and `XP_AWARDS, XPAwardResponse` from shared
  - XP calculation in PATCH /:id/complete after drill transaction
  - Per-question XP: +5 per question answered (XP_AWARDS.DRILL_QUESTION)
  - Drill completion bonus: +20 (XP_AWARDS.DRILL_COMPLETE)
  - Perfect score bonus: +50 if score === 100 (XP_AWARDS.DRILL_PERFECT_SCORE)
  - `xpUpdate` field in response with XPAwardResponse data
  - Graceful degradation: try/catch with logging, xpUpdate is undefined on failure
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Drills use same pattern as exams/study for XP integration (post-transaction, try/catch, graceful degradation)
  - Drill routes are in separate drills.ts file, not in study.ts
  - Drills use studySessions table with sessionType='timed_drill'
  - XP is calculated from totalCount (all questions answered), not just correct ones
---

## Wed 22 Jan 2026 - US-008
- Integrated XP awards into spaced repetition review submissions
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/routes/questions.ts`
- Added:
  - Import `awardCustomXP` from xpService and `XP_AWARDS, XPAwardResponse` from shared
  - XP award in POST /review endpoint after streak update
  - Awards +3 XP per card reviewed (XP_AWARDS.SR_CARD_REVIEWED)
  - `xpUpdate` field in response with XPAwardResponse data
  - Graceful degradation: try/catch with logging, xpUpdate is undefined on failure
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Spaced repetition review endpoint is in questions.ts (POST /review), NOT in study.ts
  - The PRD acceptance criteria mentioned study.ts but the actual SR review endpoint is in questions.ts
  - Same pattern as other XP integrations: award after main logic, try/catch, graceful degradation
