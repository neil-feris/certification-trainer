## Codebase Patterns
- All shared types live in a single file: `packages/shared/src/index.ts` (direct exports, no submodules)
- Build order matters: shared → server → client
- Use `$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.2.0/bin/node` to bypass shell nvm loading issues in sandbox
- Server typecheck requires `node_modules` installed (drizzle-orm etc) - pre-existing errors without install
- Client typecheck works standalone with shared dist built
- Commit using `git -C <path> commit -m "msg"` to avoid heredoc temp file issues

## 2026-01-25 - US-001
- Implemented shared TypeScript interfaces for readiness score API contract
- Added: ConfidenceLevel, DomainReadiness, ReadinessScore, ReadinessRecommendation, ReadinessSnapshot, ReadinessResponse
- Files changed: `packages/shared/src/index.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Types go at the end of `packages/shared/src/index.ts` grouped by feature with a comment header
  - No import/export barrel files - everything is flat exported from the single index.ts
  - Shared package builds with just `tsc` (no bundler)
